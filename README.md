# devjs-test

The app allows:
 - Create a post which has title and content.
 - Modify title and content once it's been created.
 - Leave a comment below a paricular post.
 - Modify created by you comments.
 - Delete created by you comments.
 - Delete the posts you've created.

The app is not actually secure, because anyone can change any post by switching the fingerprint, which allows the app to understand who does a post/comment belong to.
The solution of the problem  is quite simple, make posts' fingerprint invisible to anyone.
